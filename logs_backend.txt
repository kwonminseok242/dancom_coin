(node:14179) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///Users/kwonminseok/Desktop/2025y/11m/sFIAT%20Stablecoin/backend/server.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /Users/kwonminseok/Desktop/2025y/11m/sFIAT Stablecoin/package.json.
